# Support Resources

Please do not use the issue tracker for questions about your own code.
The tracker is for issues related to the project itself.

Search with Google using "flask" and some keywords, an exception
message, etc. It can be helpful to add `site:stackoverflow.com` to
search Stack Overflow for answers.

Reduce your question to a [minimal reproducible example][]. This may
help you identify the issue yourself, and will make it much easier for
others to help you.

Finally, use one of the following resources for help with your code:

* The `#get-help` channel on our [Discord chat][] can be used to chat
  with and get help from other users in the community.

* The mailing list flask@python.org can be used for larger issues or
  long term discussion with the community.
  
* Ask on [Stack Overflow][]. Be sure to use the advice above to search
  and narrow down your issue first.

Flask Documentation
===================

No longer used. The docs are now built and hosted with Read the Docs.
The Sphinx themes are at https://github.com/pallets/pallets-sphinx-themes.

This repository contains sphinx styles for Flask and Flask related
projects and a wrapper script to build the online documentation.

How to build the docs (for instance Flask):

  $ pip install --editable .
  $ flask-docbuilder build --config configs/flask.json

Note that the master branch is built by the pocoo build server.
Changes here might break the build so please be careful.

How it works in general:

* themes are shared and live in the `themes` folder.
* configs about how the per-project docs are structured live in
  the `configs` folder.
* the build server runs `flask-docbuilder build-all` to generate
  all documentation and stores it on the pocoo server.
